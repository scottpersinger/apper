- Users authenticate with their Heroku account.
- Users have a list of apps. They can create a new app and select a template
to use.
- Templates will have a client part and a server part.
- Apps consist of a file tree which is stored in postgres.
- Files can be edited using the online editor.

- The main view is split into 2 panes:

  | Editor pane | Runtime pane |

The editor includes the file tree and the file edit pane.

The runtime pane includes tabs for server, client, and server console.

- The user can run their server any time. The server code is run in a Node
subprocess and connections and sent from the main web process.

- The master Node app includes a large set of packages that can be used by
the server app. If you need another package you have to add it to the master
package.json and re-deploy.

- The console pane lets the user enter arbitrary code which is executed
by the server process. If possible we should keep a consistent context
so variables keep their values.
